## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of machine learning algorithms learned during my journey into the field of machine learning.

## Implemented Algorithms

List of implemented algorithms with brief descriptions:

1. **Logistic Regression:** A classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome.

2. **Polynomial Regression:** Extends linear regression by considering polynomial features, useful for capturing non-linear relationships.

3. **SVM (Support Vector Machine):** A versatile algorithm for both classification and regression tasks, effective in high-dimensional spaces.

4. **Decision Tree:** A tree-like model where decisions are made at each node based on features, used for classification and regression.

5. **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees for improved accuracy and control over-fitting.

6. **Gradient Boosting:** A machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models.

7. **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):** An ensemble learning method that combines weak learners to create a strong learner.

8. **XGBoost:** An optimized and scalable gradient boosting library, widely used for classification and regression tasks.

9. **CatBoost:** A machine learning library designed for categorical feature support, often used in classification tasks.

10. **LightGBM:** A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, designed for efficiency and distributed training.

11. **KMeans Clustering:** A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity.

12. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** A clustering algorithm that groups together data points with similar characteristics.

13. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining important information.
